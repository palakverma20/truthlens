TruthLens is a web-based AI application that helps users identify and understand manipulative language in online messages. Powered by Google Gemini, it analyzes message intent, emotional pressure, and persuasion patterns to generate a manipulation risk score along with clear, human-friendly explanations. By focusing on explainability rather than simple labeling, TruthLens promotes digital awareness and critical thinking, helping users recognize urgency, fear, authority, and financial pressure before reacting.
